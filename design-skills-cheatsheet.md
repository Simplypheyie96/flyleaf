# Skills Cheat Sheet — Complete

Everything installed, grouped by job. Type `/skill-name` in chat, or say "use the skill-name skill".

Namespaced entries (`plugin:name`) come from plugins — type them with the prefix.

# How to prompt with skills

## If you read nothing else

1. **You don't have to know the skill.** Describe the problem, then ask Claude to *name* the skill and wait for your yes.
2. **One look skill at a time.** Two aesthetic packs fight each other and produce mush.
3. **Give each skill a job and a boundary** — "GSAP for the pinned section only."
4. **Say what "done" means.** Otherwise Claude decides, and it decides too early.
5. **Write two or three "don'ts."** They do more work than a paragraph of description.

---

## When you don't know what you need

This is the normal case. Don't guess — use one of these three moves.

### Move 1 — Make Claude pick, then confirm

The habit that fixes most bad output. Describe the mess in your own words and hand the selection back:

```
Here's what I'm dealing with: [describe it badly, that's fine —
what's broken, what you want instead, what you've tried].

Don't build yet. Read ~/.claude/design-skills-cheatsheet.md, tell me
which 1–3 skills fit and why, and what you'd do with each. I'll
confirm before you start.
```

This is better than trusting a silent pick, because you see the choice before it costs you a build. If the reasoning sounds wrong, you catch it in one line instead of after 200 lines of code.

### Move 2 — Use a router skill

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `/ui-skills-root` | "Which UI skills apply here?" Picks the smallest useful set for you. |
| `/layers-orient` | Something's wrong with the *product*, not the code. Finds your bottleneck layer. |
| `/improve` | Point it at a codebase; get back prioritized, self-contained plans. |
| `/improve-animations` | Same, but for motion. |
| `/find-animation-opportunities` | "Should anything here animate?" — it also says what shouldn't. |
| `/animation-vocabulary` | You can describe the effect but can't name it. Gives you the technical term to search on. |
| `/better-interface` | Holistic review of a whole screen or flow. Coordinates the six `better-*` skills below. Quick or full mode. |

> **Not `/ask-matt`.** It reads like a general router but it isn't — it's Matt Pocock's *engineering* flow, and 9 of the 20 skills it points to aren't installed, including its whole spine (`/to-spec` → `/to-tickets` → `/implement`). It will route you to things that don't exist. See [Engineering process](#engineering-process) for the parts that do work.

### Move 3 — Route by symptom

Say the symptom out loud and read across.

| What you'd actually say | Start with |
|---|---|
| "It looks generic / AI-made." | `/redesign-existing-projects`, then one look pack |
| "It looks fine but feels cheap." | `/better-ui` → `/beautiful-shadows` → `/better-typography` |
| "It's cramped / crowded." | `/baseline-ui`, then `refactoring-ui-skills:04-apply-consistent-spacing` |
| "I don't know what to look at first." | `refactoring-ui-skills:01-establish-visual-hierarchy` |
| "The colors are off." | `/better-colors` |
| "It's static and boring." | `/find-animation-opportunities` *before* any animation skill |
| "The animation feels janky." | `/60fps-animation` or `/fixing-motion-performance` |
| "I want it to feel expensive." | `/high-end-visual-design` or `/emil-design-eng` |
| "I have a reference I like." | `/web-clone` or `/firecrawl-website-design-clone` |
| "I have a video of an animation I want to rebuild." | `/animation-reverse-engineering` |
| "I rebuilt it and it's *almost* right." | `/animation-reverse-engineering` — measures what eyeballing missed |
| "I don't know what to build yet." | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| "I know what to build, it's big." | `superpowers:writing-plans` |
| "It's broken and I can't tell why." | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` or `/diagnosing-bugs` |
| "Is this actually finished?" | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` |
| "Is this any good?" | `/web-quality-audit` or `/web-design-guidelines` |
| "Can everyone use it?" | `/fixing-accessibility` |

---

## The stacking formula

Skills fall into four roles. Take one from each, in this order.

| Order | Role | Job | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Process** | Decides *how* the work happens. Gates everything. | `superpowers:brainstorming`, `/design-first-ui-prompting`, `/tdd` |
| 2 | **System** | The look. **One only.** | `/dark-glass-clean-layout`, `/swiss-design`, `/orange-clean-paper-saas` |
| 3 | **Technique** | One specific mechanism. | `/gsap-scrolltrigger`, `/masked-reveal`, `/progressive-blur` |
| 4 | **QA** | Checks the result before handoff. | `/web-design-guidelines`, `/fixing-accessibility`, `/review-animations` |

**Never stack two look packs.** They're complete systems — color, type scale, surfaces, spacing. Two of them average into something that looks like neither. Want a blend? Pick one as the base and describe the borrowed part in words: *"`/swiss-design` as the base, but frosted panels on the pricing cards only."*

**Never reuse a pack across projects, either.** Stacking two is one failure mode; running the same one on everything you build is the other, and it's the slower, harder one to notice. See [One pack, one project](#look-packs-aesthetic-systems).

**Three to five skills is the ceiling.** Past that, the early instructions get diluted by the later ones.

**Mechanical note:** the CLI only autocompletes a `/` at the very start of your message. Lead with one slash, name the rest in prose — Claude still picks them up.

---

## Template — one skill

The failure mode is under-specifying and letting the skill fill gaps with its defaults.

**Weak**

```
/landing-page make me a landing page for my prediction app
```

**Strong**

```
/landing-page

Product: [what it is, in one line]
Audience: [who, what device, what constraints they have]
Single offer: [the one action the page exists to get]
Sections: [list them yourself] — nothing else.
Tone: [two adjectives] Not: [the tone you keep getting]
Stack: [framework + CSS] Must hold at [min width].
Deliver: [exact files]. Write real copy — no lorem, no "[Your headline here]".
Don't: [2–3 banned patterns]
```

The order is deliberate: **product → audience → the one offer → your section list → tone → stack → deliverable → hard nos.** The "Don't" line does the most work, because it blocks the defaults the skill would otherwise reach for.

---

## Template — several skills

```
/superpowers:brainstorming

Use these skills, in this order, each with a specific job:

1. superpowers:brainstorming — pin the concept with me FIRST.
   Ask your questions, wait for my answers, do NOT write code this turn.
2. [look pack] — the visual system for the whole thing.
   This is the only look skill; don't blend anything else in.
3. [technique] — for [specific section] ONLY.
   Everything else uses plain CSS transitions.
4. [QA skill] — run it over the finished build and fix what it flags
   before you hand back.

Build: [what, for whom]
Sections: [list]
Stack: [framework, CSS, libs] — [min width]
Done = [the 2–3 conditions that make this actually finished]
```

Four things make this work:

- **Each skill has a job**, not just a mention — "for the pinned section ONLY" stops a technique skill from taking over the page.
- **The first skill is a gate** — "do not write code this turn" is what stops Claude bulldozing from plan straight into build, so you never get to steer.
- **Boundaries are explicit** — "this is the only look skill" prevents drift.
- **"Done =" is defined** — otherwise Claude stops when the result looks plausible.

---

## Framing rules that change the output most

**Scope every skill.** Skills are greedy — they apply themselves to everything unless told where to stop. *"`/glassmorphism` on the nav and modals only; cards stay flat."*

**Put the gate first and make it block.** Process skills only work if you say "don't build yet."

**List the sections yourself.** If you don't, you get the default six-section SaaS page every time.

**Write the "don't" line.** Two or three banned patterns beats three paragraphs of positive description.

**Define done.** "Builds clean, passes the a11y skill, works at 360px" gives Claude something to verify against.

**Restate the stack when iterating.** By turn 5 the skill from turn 1 has faded. *"Same stack as before — dark-glass-clean-layout + gsap-scrolltrigger — now redo pricing."*

---

## When the output is wrong

Don't start over. Name what happened and re-scope.

| What went wrong | Say this |
|---|---|
| Generic despite the look pack | "You didn't apply [skill]. Show me which of its rules you used, then redo." |
| Right look, wrong feel | "Keep the system. Change [one specific thing]. Nothing else moves." |
| Too much animation | "Remove all motion except [one thing]. Re-read `/find-animation-opportunities`." |
| It built before you were ready | "Stop. Back to `superpowers:brainstorming`. Don't write code until I say go." |
| Drifted over several turns | "Re-read the stack: [skills]. Audit what you built against them and list the violations." |
| Claimed done, isn't | "Run `superpowers:verification-before-completion` and show me the evidence." |

**The general fix:** you don't need to know the right skill. You need to describe the symptom precisely and make Claude name its choice before it spends a build on it.

---

## Start here

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/frontend-design` | General design-engineering baseline. Safe default for any UI work. |
| `/design` | General design entry point. |
| `/design-first-ui-prompting` | Design-first, spec-driven prompt structure before you generate UI. |
| `/design-lab` | Interviews you, generates 5 distinct UI variations, collects feedback. |
| `/prototype` | Builds 3–5 genuinely different versions of one UI piece behind a live visual picker, then promotes the one you choose. **Explicit invocation only.** Sub-commands: `x5`, `riff <name>`, `keep <name>`. |
| `/ui-skills-root` | Selects the smallest useful UI-skills context via CLI. |
| `/pick-ui-library` | Picks the right library for a task (number inputs, OTP, etc.). |
| `/image-to-code` | Generates a visual reference image first, then builds to it. |
| `/budge` | Single-property CSS/Tailwind visual tweaks in Next.js App Router. |

> `/design-lab` vs `/prototype`, both diverge differently. `/design-lab` interviews you first and explores a *screen*. `/prototype` skips the interview, takes one *component* ("the toast", "the pricing card"), and hands you a keyboard-flippable picker plus a promote step that writes the winner into the codebase.

**Taste / house-style overrides**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/high-end-visual-design` | Design like a high-end agency — exact fonts, spacing, shadows, card structure. |
| `/emil-design-eng` | Emil Kowalski's philosophy on UI polish, component design, animation decisions. |
| `/bencium-innovative-ux-designer` | Distinctive, production-grade interfaces with high design quality. |
| `/design-taste-frontend` | Senior UI/UX engineer persona; overrides default LLM biases, metric-based enforcement. |
| `/design-taste-frontend-v1` | Original v1 of the above, preserved for projects depending on exact behavior. |
| `/gpt-taste` | Elite UX/UI + GSAP motion engineer; randomized layout variance. |
| `/stitch-design-taste` | Generates agent-friendly DESIGN.md enforcing a semantic design system. |
| `/ui-ux-pro-max` | Local searchable DB — 84 styles, 192 color palettes, web + mobile. |
| `/frontend-ui-engineering` | Production-quality accessible, responsive UI. |
| `/full-output-enforcement` | Bans placeholder/truncated code; forces complete output. |

---

## Whole pages & site types

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/landing-page` | High-converting single-offer landing page. Structure and strategy only, no look imposed. |
| `/landing-page-design` | Same job, but ships a **complete look system**: Geist/Manrope/Poppins only, Inter and Roboto banned, no italics, Tailwind type scale enforced, fixed radii and dark-mode colors. See the warning below. |
| `/compact-landing` | Compact, distinctive landing pages without repeating one template. |
| `/pricing-page` | High-converting SaaS pricing page — structure, plan design, copy. |
| `/product-proof-saas` | SaaS/AI landing pages built around a real workflow or interface demo. |
| `/operational-enterprise-ai` | Enterprise AI / automation / security / ops product pages. |
| `/editorial-portfolio-chapters` | Creative-studio, photographer, artist, portfolio sites. |
| `/editorial-service-booking` | Appointment-based sites — salons, spas, clinics, studios. |
| `/documentary-brutalist-agency` | Agency, production studio, architecture, culture sites. |
| `/agency-grid-layout-minimal` | Minimal agency system — editorial grid, oversized type. |
| `/redesign-existing-projects` | Audits an existing site, removes generic AI patterns, upgrades to premium. |
| `/web-clone` | Website cloning/recreation methodology. |

> **`/landing-page-design` ships a house style, and its description has been narrowed on purpose.** As published it told Claude to fire on "ANY landing page, marketing site, web UI, page section, component, or prototype, even when the user does not mention design," which meant it could switch itself on for a single card and quietly impose Geist, Tailwind's type scale, its radii and its motion. That collides with your no-house-style rule. The description now says: landing and marketing pages only, only when you have no direction of your own, never for app UI, components, prototypes, or a project that already has a `DESIGN.md`, a `refs/` folder, or an established look. It also now forbids two things outright: overriding a look that already exists, and being reused across more than one page or site. The body is untouched, so invoking it by name still gives you the whole system. Original file backed up at `~/.claude/skills/landing-page-design/.SKILL.md.orig`. **A repo update will overwrite this edit.**
| `/firecrawl-website-design-clone` | Extracts a live site's design system into an agent-ready DESIGN.md. |
| `/interface-design` | Dashboards, admin panels, SaaS apps, settings, data interfaces. |
| `/efecto-web-design` | Build web pages/app UIs on the Efecto canvas with JSX + Tailwind. |

---

## Look packs (aesthetic systems)

Complete design systems — colors, type, surfaces, components — in one voice.

> **One pack, one project. Never reuse.** A look pack is a finished identity, not a starting point. Run the same pack twice and the two sites read as the same company, which is the exact thing your no-house-style rule exists to prevent. Before reaching for one, check the project's `DESIGN.md`, its `refs/` folder, and its existing code. If a direction is already there, build from it and skip the pack. If nothing is there, pick one you have not used before, or ask for two or three directions and choose. Keep a note of which pack went to which project so the second use never happens by accident.
>
> **Packs never override.** A pack applied to a project that already has a look will flatten it. If a look already exists, no pack runs. Say it was skipped and why.

### Canvas UI (external registry, not installed)

**[canvasui.dev](https://canvasui.dev)** · free, open source, no API key, no package dependency. 33 WebGL effects that render your real HTML *inside* a canvas, so the content underneath stays interactive and selectable. Ships in React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Preact, and vanilla TS, so it does not care about your stack.

**Nothing here is installed.** This is a catalog so the options are known when a project actually calls for one. To pull a single component into a project:

```
npx shadcn@latest add @canvas-ui/liquid-react
```

Register it once per project in that project's `components.json`:

```json
{ "registries": { "@canvas-ui": "https://canvasui.dev/r/{name}.json" } }
```

There is also a shadcn MCP (`npx shadcn@latest mcp init --client claude`) that lets Claude browse and install these directly. Deliberately not set up, because it is one more thing that can auto-fire. Revisit if you find yourself reaching for these often.

> **Read before shipping any of these.** They are built on the **html-in-canvas API, a Chrome origin trial**. Experimental, Chromium only, with Firefox partially supported on some components. Elsewhere the page degrades to plain HTML. Fine for a portfolio, a launch page, or a demo. Think hard before putting one in front of real users on unknown browsers. All are dependency free except the five **Object** components, which need three.js.
>
> **One effect, one project.** These are the most memorable things on this list, which makes them the fastest route to every site of yours looking related. Same rule as the look packs: use one, note it in that project's `DESIGN.md`, do not reach for it again.

**Whole-page atmosphere** (covers the entire page)

| Component | Effect |
|---|---|
| `asciify` | Page redrawn as live ASCII glyphs in a radius around the cursor. |
| `canvas` | Page painted onto woven artist canvas: fiber, paper tint, grain, halftone. Text stays crisp. |
| `cloth` | Page hung on fabric rippling in wind. Cursor strokes send waves across it. |
| `clouds` | Procedural fog that blurs what it covers and parts at the cursor. |
| `vhs` | Worn VHS playback: tape wave, head-switch noise, chroma bleed, grain. |
| `glitch` | Broadcast glitch bursts, RGB splits, corrupted blocks, then settles clean. |
| `frost` | Ice pane over the page. Hover melts a hole that freezes back over. |
| `droplets` | Rain running down the screen, refracting the page behind. |
| `blaze` | Fire, sparks, smoke, and heat distortion rising from the bottom edge. |
| `glyph-rain` | Glowing glyph streams whose drop heads cast real light pools onto the page. |
| `force-field` | Energy shield lattice. Cursor charges cells, clicks detonate shockwaves. |

**Cursor lenses** (local, follows the pointer)

| Component | Effect |
|---|---|
| `liquid` | Pointer-driven WebGL fluid simulation over the page. The signature one. |
| `glass` | Glass lens refracting the live page, with crystal-ball zoom over targets. |
| `magnify` | Sci-fi HUD scanner reticle, chromatic aberration, click ripples. |
| `bubble` | Glassy metaball droplet trailing the cursor: dispersion, frost, iridescence. |
| `retro-dither` | Lens that pixelates and quantizes the page around the cursor. |
| `particle-reveal` | Page as fine grayscale dust, merging back into crisp UI at the cursor. |
| `decrypt-reveal` | Page as ASCII cipher text, decoding behind a flickering wavefront. |

**Page geometry** (deforms the layout itself)

| Component | Effect |
|---|---|
| `grid` | Page split into 3D tiles rippling in waves around the cursor. |
| `hex-float` | Live page on beveled hex tiles leaning in perspective, rising at the cursor. |
| `shatter` | Page shatters into 3D glass shards that lift, tilt, and float. |
| `displacement` | Displacement grid rippling from the cursor, chromatic fringing, film grain. |
| `ripple` | Water ripples spreading from every click, with dispersion and crest glints. |
| `peel` | Page peels back from a chosen edge, revealing a second layer underneath. |

**Scroll-driven**

| Component | Effect |
|---|---|
| `bend` | Top and bottom fold over virtual edges as you scroll, like a cube face. |
| `particle-scroll` | Everything below a chosen line dissolves into sand, reassembling on scroll. |
| `laser` | Glowing beam hides content below it. Scrolling prints new content in from behind. |

**3D objects** (three.js, needs a GLB/glTF model, SVG, or image)

| Component | Effect |
|---|---|
| `glass-object` | Liquid-glass object: real refraction, chromatic dispersion, frost, studio lighting. |
| `liquid-object` | Object dragged through an invisible GPU fluid that swirls under the cursor. |
| `particle-object` | Object rebuilt as a particle cloud the cursor pushes, swirls, and springs back. |
| `ascii-object` | Object as ASCII characters chosen by shape, so glyphs trace its edges. |
| `dithered-object` | Object through 1-bit Bayer, halftone, or Floyd-Steinberg dither. |

**Element-scoped**

| Component | Effect |
|---|---|
| `flame-wrap` | Wraps one element in an aligned fire border: rising flames, molten glow, sparks. |

---

## Animation

**Decide what to animate**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/find-animation-opportunities` | Finds what *should* animate and rejects what shouldn't. |
| `/animation-vocabulary` | Turns a vague description of an effect into its exact technical name. |
| `/animation-systems` | Product-grade motion systems à la Stripe, Linear, Apple, Vercel. |
| `/interaction-design` | Microinteractions, transitions, user feedback patterns. |
| `/to-spring-or-not-to-spring` | Springs vs easing — correct timing-function selection. |

**Rebuild motion you've seen somewhere**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/animation-reverse-engineering` | Video, GIF, or screen recording → frame-level dissection → production code, then verified back against the source frames. Measures easing, stagger order, and overlap instead of guessing them. Defaults to Framer Motion; the analysis is framework-agnostic. |

> **Which of the two reference skills.** `/video-to-superprompt` watches a video and writes you a *description* to build from — fast, no dependencies, good enough when the motion is simple. `/animation-reverse-engineering` extracts the actual frames with `ffmpeg` and *measures* the curve, then screenshots your build and diffs it against the reference. Reach for it when a recreation came out subtly wrong and you can't say why — that's almost always easing or stagger feather, and those are exactly what eyeballing at 1× gets wrong. Needs `ffmpeg`; also `yt-dlp` for X/Twitter and YouTube sources (direct `.mp4`/`.gif` links and local files work without it).

**Build it**

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/micro-interaction` | Hover/press effects, toggles, switches. |
| `/transitions-dev` | 27 drop-in CSS transitions, `t-*` namespaced with motion tokens. Badges, dropdowns, modals, toasts, tabs, accordions, toggles, skeletons, success checks. No framework, every snippet ships its own `prefers-reduced-motion` guard. [transitions.dev](https://transitions.dev) |
| `/transitions-polish` | The **tuning** half. Does not add motion, it fixes motion that already exists: duration, distance, scale, blur, easing, open/close asymmetry, hover-in vs hover-out, stagger offsets, intent delays. Also scans a codebase for ad-hoc hardcoded durations and converts them to tokens. |
| `/animation-on-scroll` | IntersectionObserver scroll triggers, Tailwind-friendly. |
| `/page-transition-animation` | Page and route transitions. |
| `/svg-animation` | Animate SVG, line-draw, stroke effects. |
| `/morphing-icons` | Icons that morph into each other via SVG line transformation. |
| `/lottie-animation` | Play/control `.lottie` and `.json` animations. |
| `/text-to-lottie` | Create/edit/fix Lottie JSON for the Skia Skottie player. |
| `/mastering-animate-presence` | Framer Motion / Motion `AnimatePresence` exit + layout animations. |
| `/staggered-word-reveal` | Editorial word-by-word fade-and-rise reveals. |
| `/masked-reveal` | Masked staggered word reveals on scroll (GSAP ScrollTrigger). |

> **The two `transitions-*` skills are a pair, and they split cleanly.** `/transitions-dev` *adds* a transition that isn't there. `/transitions-polish` *tunes* one that is. If motion exists and feels wrong, reach for polish, not dev.
>
> **Where polish overlaps your other motion skills.** `/60fps-animation` and `/fixing-motion-performance` are about *jank*, dropped frames and layout thrash, a performance problem. `/transitions-polish` is about *taste*, timing that is technically smooth but feels sluggish or abrupt. `/review-animations` and `/improve-animations` audit broadly and hand back a list. Polish is the narrow one that aligns everything to a single token scale. Use one, not three.
>
> **There is a paid tier, `transitions-pro`.** More recipes plus React and TypeScript versions, unlocked with a browser sign-in at [transitions.dev/pro](https://transitions.dev/pro.html). Not installed, and Claude will not sign you up. If you want it, run `npx transitions-pro skill` yourself.

**About `/ask-matt`.** It's a router, but only over *this* set — Matt Pocock's engineering workflow. It is not a general "which skill should I use" helper, and it currently routes to 9 skills you don't have installed: `/grill-me`, `/handoff`, `/to-spec`, `/to-tickets`, `/implement`, `/wayfinder`, `/research`, `/teach`, `/writing-great-skills`. That includes the spine of the whole flow (`/to-spec` → `/to-tickets` → `/implement`), so following its advice will dead-end.

What's actually installed and works: `/grill-with-docs`, `/domain-modeling`, `/codebase-design`, `/diagnosing-bugs`, `/triage`, `/tdd`, `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`. For planning and execution use `superpowers:brainstorming` → `superpowers:writing-plans` → `superpowers:executing-plans` instead — that chain is fully installed.

Not skills — these are live tool connections and outside sites. Skills are *knowledge*; MCP servers are *hands*. Name the server in your prompt ("use efecto to…", "pull a component from originkit") and Claude reaches for its tools.

## Connected MCP servers

| Server | What it gives Claude | Invoke with |
|---|---|---|
| **efecto** | 68 design tools — artboards, JSX/Tailwind layouts, brand kits, image search, PNG/SVG export, "open in v0". Designs render live in your browser. | "use **efecto** to design…" |
| **originkit** | Component library — list and pull ready-made components into a build. [originkit.dev](https://originkit.dev) | "check **originkit** for a…" |
| **pencil** | Editor for `.pen` design files (encrypted — only Pencil tools can read them). | "in **pencil**…" |
| **paper** | Paper Design — HTML writing surface. Runs locally on port 29979. | "use **paper** to…" |

Companion skills for Efecto: `/efecto-web-design` · `/efecto-graphic-design` · `/efecto-social-media`

Check what's connected: `claude mcp list`. Re-add originkit if it ever drops (token is in `~/.claude.json`, not repeated here):

```
claude mcp add originkit https://mcp.originkit.dev/mcp --transport http --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" --scope user
```

## External sites (no MCP — you drive these, then bring the output back)

| Site | What it's for | Pairs with |
|---|---|---|
| [ascii-magic.com](https://www.ascii-magic.com/) | Image/video → ASCII art. Dither engine, text-to-ASCII, dither animation builder, gradient shader, backgrounds. | `/ascii-animation`, `/dither-background`, `/dither-laser-dark-mode` |
| [beam.jakubantalik.com](https://beam.jakubantalik.com/) | Live demo + docs for `border-beam`. | `/beam-glow-states` |
| [orbs.jakubantalik.com](https://orbs.jakubantalik.com/) | Live demo + docs for `thinking-orbs`. | `/thinking-orbs` |
| [metal.jakubantalik.com](https://metal.jakubantalik.com/) | Live demo + docs for `metal-fx` liquid metal shader. | `/liquid-metal-border` |

The three npm packages are installed **per project**, not globally — run this in each new project that needs them:

```
npm install thinking-orbs border-beam metal-fx
```
